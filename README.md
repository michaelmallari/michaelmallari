### Ivy League-Educated, Private K-12 Computer Science Tutor

I’m an engineer by trade.  With my undergraduate degree in computer science, I spent the first 12 years of my career as a developer.  Career opportunities and an MBA education (#GoTerps 🐢) took me from being a developer to being a product designer, to being a product manager.  I like to say that my career of 20+ years has evolved from "building the solutions right" (as an engineer), to "building the right solutions” for customers (as a product designer), to leading my team in creating delightful customer experiences that align with business goals (as a product manager).

After an additional graduate Ivy League education (MS in Applied Analytics from Columbia University 🦁) and understanding the needs of TODAY'S students, I have developed a student-centric, personalized learning experience approach to bring passion and interest in computer science to today's K-12 students.  And I'm here to help you!

* Career opportunities with a computer science education
* K-12 progress milestones
* Admissions to Ivy League schools
* Roadmap to get that first $100k job straight out of college
