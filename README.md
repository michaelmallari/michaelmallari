### Ivy League Adjunct Faculty + CS Tutor/Coach

<img src="https://www.michaelmallari.com/img/headshot.jpg" width="120" height="120" align="right" />

I‚Äôm an engineer-by-trade, data-driven, and product-oriented.  I use my CS and MBA background to deliver value to customers and the business through emerging technologies.  

I've used my software engineering, product design, product management, and data science experience to discover, define, and deliver large-scale, technically-complex, next-gen solutions‚Äîfrom Web 1.0 (during the late '90s and early 2000s dot-com boom) to (recently) 5G mobility, and (now) AI.  And I've used 20+ years of successful outcomes with Fortune 500 companies, startups, and not-for-profit organizations to make my impact and level-up again and again.

I also offer the next-generation of talented students the tutoring and coaching to level-up for this AI-first era.  As an adjunct faculty member at Columbia University, I offer my private tutoring/coaching students exposure to the same, rapidly-evolving tech stack that my Ivy League students are exposed to.

Ready to impress and stand-out from the crowd?  I'm here to help. ü§ù
