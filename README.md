### Product Manager | Ex-Designer | Ex-Software Engineer

I‚Äôm an engineer by trade.  With my undergraduate degree in computer science, I spent the first 12 years of my career as a developer.  Career opportunities and graduate education took me from being a developer to being a designer (in preparation for what's next).  Today, I‚Äôm a product manager‚Äî7 years strong!

I like to say that my career of 20+ years has evolved from "building the solutions right" (as an engineer), to "building the right solutions‚Äù for customers (as a designer), to leading my team in our obsession to serve our customers (as a product manager).

Most of the programming I currently do is with Julia, Python, and R for data science.  I'm bullish that data science will graduate from Python and R, and onto Julia‚Äîwhich is why I'm a [GitHub Sponsor of the Julia Programming Language](https://github.com/sponsors/JuliaLang) and the founder/organizer of the [Julia5280 meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Julia5280-Julia-Programming-Language/) based in Denver/Boulder, CO.
