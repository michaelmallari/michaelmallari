### Ivy League-Educated, K-12 CS Tutor (side-hustle)

<img src="https://www.michaelmallari.com/img/headshot.jpg" width="120" height="120" align="right" />

I’m an engineer by trade.  With my undergraduate degree in computer science, I spent the first 12 years of my career as a developer.  New career opportunities and an MBA education (from the University of Maryland 🐢) took me from being a developer to being a product designer, to being a product manager.  I like to say that my career of 20+ years has evolved from "building the solutions right" (as an engineer), to "building the right solutions” for customers (as a product designer), to leading my team in creating delightful customer experiences that align with business goals (as a product manager).

After an additional graduate Ivy League education (MS in Applied Analytics from Columbia University 🦁) and witnessing the needs of TODAY'S students, I have developed a student-centric, personalized learning experience approach to spark an interest in and passion for AI in today's K-12 students.  I'm here to help! 

💬 **Ask me about**
* Career opportunities with a CS education (with emphasis on AI)
* K-12 educational milestones in CS
* Admissions to Ivy League schools
* Roadmap to get that $100k job straight out of college
* Roadmap to get that first $200k job within 10 years out of college
