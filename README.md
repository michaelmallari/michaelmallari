### Chief Data & Analytics Officer ... With Hybrid Skill-Set

I‚Äôm an engineer by trade.  With my undergraduate degree in computer science, I spent the first 12 years of my career as a developer.  Career opportunities and graduate education took me from being a developer to being a product designer (in preparation for what's next).

I like to say that my career of 20+ years has evolved from "building the solutions right" (as an engineer), to "building the right solutions‚Äù for customers (as a designer), to leading my team in creating delightful customer experiences that align with business goals (as a product manager).

üí¨ Ask me about
* Leveraging data as a source, an asset, and a product
* Recruiting talent and upskilling current talent
* Applying AI/ML to spark change and create a unique competitive advantage
