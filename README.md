### Chief Data & Analytics Officer ... With Hybrid Skill-Set

I’m an engineer by trade.  With my undergraduate degree in computer science, I spent the first 12 years of my career as a developer.  Career opportunities and an MBA education (#GoTerps 🐢) took me from being a developer to being a product designer, to being a product manager.  I like to say that my career of 20+ years has evolved from "building the solutions right" (as an engineer), to "building the right solutions” for customers (as a product designer), to leading my team in creating delightful customer experiences that align with business goals (as a product manager).

Technical product management experience and additional graduate Ivy League education (MS in Applied Analytics from Columbia University 🦁) has taken me to the third chapter of my career ... in data science, AI/ML, and analytics ... to power next-generation businesses.  And I'm here to help you!

* Leveraging data as a source, data an asset, and data as a product
* Driving awareness to relevant AI/ML use cases
* Applying AI/ML to spark change and to create a unique competitive advantage
