### Product Manager | Ex-Designer | Ex-Software Engineer

My 20+ year career has evolved from "building the solutions right", to "building the right solutions", to identifying the most important problems to solve for and leading my team in the work we are all proud of.

Most of the programming I currently do is with Julia, Python, and R for data science.  I'm bullish that data science will graduate from Python and R, and onto Juliaâ€”which is why I'm a [GitHub Sponsor of the Julia Programming Language](https://github.com/sponsors/JuliaLang) and the founder/organizer of the [Julia5280 meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Julia5280-Julia-Programming-Language/) based in Denver/Boulder.
