### Ivy League Adjunct Faculty + CS Tutor/Coach

<img src="https://www.michaelmallari.com/img/headshot.jpg" width="120" height="120" align="right" />

I‚Äôm an engineer by trade.  With my undergraduate degree in computer science, I spent the first 12 years of my career as a developer.  New career opportunities and an MBA education (from the University of Maryland üê¢) took me from being a developer to being a product designer, to being a product manager.  I like to say that my career of 20+ years has evolved from "building the solutions right" (as an engineer), to "building the right solutions‚Äù for customers (as a product designer), to leading my team in creating delightful customer experiences that align with business goals (as a product manager).

Witnessing the needs of TODAY'S students after an additional graduate Ivy League education (MS in Applied Analytics from Columbia University ü¶Å) and as an adjunct faculty member (again, at Columbia), I'm helping students and early career professionals (YOU!) to stand out from the crowd.  I'm here to help. ü§ù 

üí¨ **Ask me about**
* Career opportunities with a CS education (with emphasis on AI)
* K-12 educational milestones in CS
* Admissions to Ivy League STEM programs
* Roadmap to get that $100k job straight out of college
