Michael is a hybrid thinker and doer—a byproduct of being a CliftonStrengths "Learner" over time. As a seasoned leader (20+ years) with hands-on "product trio" experiences (software engineering, product design, and product management), he helps organizations discover market needs, mobilize internal and external resources, and deliver delightful customer experiences that align with business goals—in this *AI-first* era.

He has been entrusted with problem-solving for brands—ranging from Fortune 500 companies to early-stage startups to not-for-profit organizations.

Michael earned his MS in Applied Analytics from Columbia University, MBA from the University of Maryland, College Park, and BS in Computer Science from New York Institute of Technology.
